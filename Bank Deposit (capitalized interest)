//The depositor deposited a certain amount of money in the Bank. This amount is increased annually by a percentage (percent > 0) of the current Deposit amount. Determine how much money will be on the account in a period of years?

//Write a function named bankPercent that takes three numbers as arguments:

//money (initial Deposit amount);
//percent (capitalized Bank interest);
//period (number of years),
//and returns the amount of money on the Deposit after a period of years. Round the result to two decimal places.

//In this type of Deposit, the amount increases annually by p percent of the available (current) amount:

//s = s + s * p / 100;
//In the solution, use the do while loop.

function bankPercent(money, percent, period){
  let sum = money;
  let year = 0;
    do { 
      sum = sum + sum * percent / 100;
      year++;
    }
    while ( year < period);
 return sum.toFixed(2);
}
